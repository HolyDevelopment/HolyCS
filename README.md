# HolyCS
The continuation of HolyC, but now it's Sharp

 Literally the worst idea ever.
 HolyC# is an (esoteric?) programming language based on C#, made to be more holy than HolyC.
 The plan is to almost completely change everything in C# to a more holier version. (ex. Console is replaced with God)

# Why?
 idk lol
